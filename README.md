Hi, I'm Micah Ezirim, a detail-driven Data Analyst with a passion for uncovering hidden patterns and telling compelling stories with data. With a strong foundation in data analysis and a portfolio of projects showcasing my skills (featured here on GitHub), I'm excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities in data analytics.

Whether it's a paid project, volunteer collaboration, or simply a chance to geek out over data, I'm open to discussing how we can work together to drive insights and impact. Let's connect and explore the possibilities! You can also find me on Instagram @micah_nd.

Feel free to explore my projects, and let's start a conversation about how data analytics can drive value for your organization.
